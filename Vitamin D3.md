# Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) – Complete Notes

## 1. What is Vitamin D3?
Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) is a **fat‑soluble vitamin** that plays a crucial role in:
- Calcium and phosphorus absorption  
- Bone and teeth strength  
- Muscle function  
- Immune system regulation  
- Hormone and cell growth regulation  

Vitamin D3 is the **natural form** of vitamin D produced in human skin when exposed to sunlight.

## 2. Forms of Vitamin D
- **Vitamin D2 (Ergocalciferol)** – plant-derived, less effective  
- **Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol)** – animal-derived, **more potent and longer lasting**  

> Vitamin D3 is preferred for supplementation.

## 3. Daily Requirement (RDA)

### Recommended Intake (Adults)

| Category | Vitamin D |
|-------|-----------|
| Adults (19–70 years) | **600 IU (15 µg)/day** |
| Adults (>70 years) | **800 IU (20 µg)/day** |
| Upper safe limit (long-term) | **4000 IU (100 µg)/day** |

> Individual needs vary based on sunlight exposure, skin tone, age, and health conditions.

---

## 4. Units & Conversion
- **1 microgram (µg) = 40 IU**
- **1500 µg = 60,000 IU**

---

## 5. Natural Sources of Vitamin D3

### Sunlight (Primary Source)

---

## 8. Diagnosis

### Blood Test
- **Serum 25‑hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]**

### Interpretation
- **< 20 ng/mL** → Deficient  
- **20–30 ng/mL** → Insufficient  
- **30–50 ng/mL** → Optimal  
- **> 100 ng/mL** → Toxic  

---

## 9. Supplementation (Cholecalciferol)

### Common Strengths
- 400 IU
- 800 IU
- 1000 IU
- 2000 IU
- **60,000 IU (1500 µg)**

### Typical Medical Regimens
**Deficiency correction**
- 60,000 IU **once weekly** for 6–8 weeks

**Maintenance**
- 1000–2000 IU daily  
OR  
- 60,000 IU once monthly

> Always follow doctor’s advice for high-dose therapy.

- Half-life of 25(OH)D ≈ **2–3 weeks**
- Effects persist for **weeks to months**

---

## 12. Vitamin D Toxicity (Overdose)

### Causes
- Long-term excessive supplementation
- High-dose use without monitoring

### Symptoms
