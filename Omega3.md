## 1. What is Omega-3?
Omega-3 fatty acids are **essential polyunsaturated fats** that the body cannot make on its own.
The three main types are:
- **EPA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid)** – heart & anti-inflammatory benefits
- **DHA (Docosahexaenoic Acid)** – brain, nerves & eye health
- **ALA (Alpha-Linolenic Acid)** – plant-based precursor (poorly converted)

---

## 2. Why Omega-3 is Important
Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for:
- Heart and blood vessel health  
- Brain and nervous system function  
- Eye (retina) health  
- Reducing inflammation  
- Healthy skin and hair  

---

## 3. Daily Requirement (Recommended Intake)

### Healthy Adults
- **250–500 mg per day (EPA + DHA combined)**

### Specific Conditions
- Heart disease prevention: **500–1000 mg/day**
- High triglycerides: **2000–4000 mg/day** (medical supervision)

> There is no official RDA, but these ranges are globally accepted.

---

## 4. Natural Sources of Omega-3

### Animal Sources (Best Absorption)
- Fatty fish (salmon, sardine, mackerel, tuna)
- Fish oil supplements

### Plant Sources
- Flaxseed & flaxseed oil
- Chia seeds
- Walnuts
- Mustard oil

> ⚠️ Plant omega-3 (ALA) converts to EPA/DHA at only **5–10% efficiency**.

---

## 5. Omega-3 in Supplements (Important)
- **Fish oil amount ≠ Omega-3 amount**
- Always check **EPA + DHA content**

### Example
- 500 mg fish oil capsule  
  - EPA: 90 mg  
  - DHA: 60 mg  
  - **Total omega-3 = 150 mg**

---

## 6. Causes of Omega-3 Deficiency
- Low fish intake
- Vegetarian or vegan diet
- High omega-6 intake (refined oils)
- Poor fat absorption
- Long-term inflammation

---

## 7. Symptoms of Omega-3 Deficiency

### Brain & Mood
- Poor concentration
- Memory issues
- Mood swings, depression

### Heart & Blood
- High triglycerides
- Increased heart disease risk

### Joints & Inflammation
- Joint pain
- Morning stiffness

### Skin, Hair & Eyes
- Dry skin
- Hair dryness & breakage
- Dry eyes, eye strain

---

## 8. Diagnosis
There is no routine test for omega-3 deficiency.
Special tests:
- Omega-3 Index (RBC test)
- Triglyceride levels (indirect clue)

---

## 9. Supplementation Guidelines

### General Health
- 500 mg EPA + DHA daily

### If You Don’t Eat Fish
- Fish oil or algae oil supplement daily

### How to Take
- Take with meals containing fat
- Consistency is more important than high dose

---

## 10. Storage of Omega-3 in the Body
- Stored in **cell membranes and fat tissue**
- Storage lasts **1–3 months**
- Levels decline within **2–4 weeks** after stopping intake

---

## 11. Safety & Upper Limits
- Generally safe up to **3000 mg/day**
- High doses may increase bleeding risk
- Consult a doctor if on blood thinners

---

## 12. Key Takeaways
- Omega-3 is essential and must come from diet
- EPA & DHA are the most important forms
- Daily need: **250–500 mg**
- Fish is the best source
- Regular intake is necessary
