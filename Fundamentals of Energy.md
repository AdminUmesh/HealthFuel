# Energy
Energy is the capacity to do work. In the context of biology and nutrition, it refers to the ability of your body to perform functions, maintain homeostasis (balance), and carry out physical activities.

### Types of Energy:

1. **Kinetic energy:** Energy associated with motion (e.g., muscle movement).
2. **Potential energy:** Stored energy (e.g., energy stored in fat or glycogen).

### Sources of Energy:
Energy comes from the food we consume. When we eat food, our body metabolizes it, breaking down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins to release energy.

# Calorie
Calories are a unit of energy. When we talk about "calories" in food, we're referring to the amount of energy the body can obtain from the food after digestion and metabolism.

### Foods contain different macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins), and each of these provides a certain number of calories per gram:

- **Carbohydrates:** 4 calories per gram
- **Proteins:** 4 calories per gram
- **Fats:** 9 calories per gram

### What do they do?
Calories are the energy that your body needs to perform all its functions, from basic survival functions (breathing, digestion, etc.) to more active processes (walking, thinking, exercise).
If you consume more calories than your body needs, the excess is `stored as fat.` If you consume fewer calories than your body needs, it burns stored fat for energy, `leading to weight loss.`
Sources of Calories:

- Foods like `grains`, `meats`, `dairy`, `fruits`, `vegetables`, and `fats` provide calories in varying amounts.

# Non-Caloric Nutrients:
`Vitamins`, `Fiber`, `Minerals`, `Water`, `Antioxidants`, `Phytochemicals`: **donâ€™t provide calories, they are essential for various bodily functions:**

### Vitamins
- **Vitamin A:** Supports vision, immune function, and skin health.
- **Vitamin C:** Boosts immunity, aids in wound healing, and acts as an antioxidant.
- **Vitamin D:** Promotes calcium absorption and supports bone health.
- **Vitamin E:** Acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage.
- **Vitamin K:** Supports blood clotting and bone health.

### Fiber:
It aids in digestion and supports heart health but is not digested and converted into energy.

### Minerals:
Essential for bone health, nerve function, and fluid balance.
### Water:
Crucial for hydration, regulating body temperature, and digestion.
### Antioxidants:
Protect cells from oxidative damage and support overall health.
### Phytochemicals:
Naturally occurring compounds in plants that support immune function, reduce inflammation, and may prevent chronic diseases.

# Energy Source is Used During Work?
When we perform physical work or engage in any activity that requires energy, the body primarily uses carbohydrates and fats as its main sources of energy. Proteins and vitamins play supportive roles, but they are not the body's primary energy sources for exercise or physical work.

### Carbohydrates (Primary Energy Source for Work)
Carbohydrates are the body's preferred energy source during physical activity, especially for high-intensity exercise.

### Fats (Secondary Energy Source)
Fats are used as a source of energy during low to moderate-intensity physical activity and during extended periods of exercise.

### Protein (Minor Role in Energy)
Proteins are not the primary energy source for physical work, but they can be used for energy in certain circumstances.

## Key Takeaways:
- Carbs are your body's primary fuel source for work, especially for short, intense activities.

- Fats serve as the main fuel for low-intensity or prolonged work.

- Proteins are mainly used for building muscles and repair but can be used for energy under extreme conditions.

- Vitamins and minerals support energy metabolism but don't directly provide calories or energy.
