# Hair Loss Treatment – Complete Notes
## Minoxidil, Finasteride & Microneedling (Dermaroller)

---

## 1. Understanding Hair Loss (Quick Overview)
The most common cause of hair loss in men is **Androgenetic Alopecia (AGA)**.
It is driven by:
- Genetics
- DHT (Dihydrotestosterone)
- Progressive miniaturization of hair follicles

Effective treatment focuses on:
- **Stimulating growth**
- **Preventing further loss**
- **Improving follicle health**

---

## 2. Minoxidil

### 2.1 What is Minoxidil?
Minoxidil is a **topical hair growth stimulant**.
It does NOT block DHT.

### How it works
- Increases blood flow to follicles
- Prolongs hair growth phase (anagen)
- Thickens miniaturized hairs

---

### 2.2 Forms of Minoxidil
- **5% Liquid** – cheaper, precise application
- **5% Foam** – less irritation, faster drying

> Foam is preferred for sensitive skin and beard use.

---

### 2.3 How to Use Minoxidil
- Apply to **dry scalp or beard skin**
- Scalp: 1 ml per application
- Beard: half capful (foam)

**Frequency**
- Scalp: once or twice daily
- Beard: once daily

---

### 2.4 Timeline of Results
| Time | What Happens |
|---|---|
| 1–2 months | Possible shedding |
| 3–4 months | Early regrowth |
| 6–9 months | Visible improvement |
| 12 months | Peak results |

---

### 2.5 Important Facts
- Results depend on consistency
- Stopping minoxidil causes minoxidil-dependent hair to shed in 2–4 months
- Does not cure hair loss, only manages it

---

## 3. Finasteride

### 3.1 What is Finasteride?
Finasteride is an **oral DHT blocker**.
It addresses the **root cause** of genetic hair loss.

---

### 3.2 How Finasteride Works
- Blocks conversion of testosterone → DHT
- Reduces scalp DHT by ~60–70%
- Slows or stops further hair loss

---

### 3.3 Dosage
- Standard dose: **1 mg per day**
- Some use alternate-day dosing to reduce side effects

---

## 4. Microneedling (Dermaroller)

### 4.1 What is Microneedling?
Microneedling uses tiny needles to create **micro-injuries** in the scalp.

Tools:
- Dermaroller
- Dermapen

---

### 4.2 Benefits of Microneedling
- Stimulates growth factors
- Improves blood supply
- Increases minoxidil absorption

> Studies show minoxidil + microneedling works better than minoxidil alone.

---

### 4.3 Needle Length & Frequency
| Needle Size | Frequency |
|---|---|
| 0.5 mm | Once weekly |
| 1.0 mm | Every 7–10 days |

---

---

## 6. Beard vs Scalp Differences
- Beard hair is less DHT‑dependent
- Beard minoxidil can often be stopped after 12–18 months
- Scalp hair usually requires long‑term maintenance

---

## 7. Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Inconsistent application
- Overuse of products
- Applying on wet skin
- Expecting results too early
